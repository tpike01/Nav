High Level Design

Steps..

1) Take a video stream from a stereo pair of cameras mounted on a robot, feed the video stream through a Stereo Matching algorithm to 
produce a disparity image for each frame, that convert this to a Point Cloud PLY file.
2) Take the PLY file and find the floor of the image, and create a 2D map in a Trinity Format 
(Trinity format, -1 unknown, 0 clear floor, 100, obsticles greater than 5mm above the floor)
3) Using the 2D map decide how to navigate based on the Trinity information. 
( forward, backwards, left and right, in a mowing the lawn strategy around the room, avoiding all 100's and only moving over 0's )
4) As you are moving get the next set of video frames, create the disparity, the PLY and then improve the 2D map, and keep naivigating
untill the lawn has been mowed.

Navigation of the room at a High Level.

Things to consider:-

Video Stream:- format, fps, dimensions
Stereo Matching algorith :- Many to choose from  SBM, SGBM, DNN based etc
PLY:- format?
How to find the floor of the room?, does the PLY need to be Transformed?
As you move merging multiple PLY's does this become computationally expensive as the size of the measurable room expands
and will this work in very large rooms.
Navigating the Robot:- 4 basic rules
(1) The room is a very basic square or rectangular room to start off with (adapt this later).
(2) only move over 0's in the Trinity map (-1's could be considered in a later design) 
(3) The robot will start in the middle of the room in a free uncluttered section of the room.
(4) Use a mow the lawn strategy to navigate.
Based on these four basic rules - decide which direction to mow the lawn in as early in the process as is possible based on the 2D map 
information - so the best thing to do when initiating the navigation is to get a 360 degree look at the room to create a good 2D map and
then work out the direction to start mowing the lawn. So turn left or right for a 360 turn, gather the 2D map and make decisions based on
the Trinity information, avoid all 100's only stay on the 0's.  
Mowing the lawn strategy, its a given that you start in the middle of the room. so with the 2D map, if you can identify a corner of the 
room then navigate to that corner if there is a clear path and start mowing the lawn from there. If you can't identify a corner, then start 
from the midlle do one half of the room and then move over to the middle again and do the other half. Once all mowing is done stop.
